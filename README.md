# Hi, I’m Akshat

Computer Science undergraduate focused on **backend development**, supported by strong **DSA fundamentals** and **applied machine learning projects**.

I build **real, end-to-end systems** — not toy demos — involving data, APIs, databases, and clear engineering decisions.

---

## What I Build

- **Backend systems** using Java, Node.js, and Python  
- **Automation pipelines** (data collection → processing → output)  
- **Machine learning projects** with real datasets, evaluation, and visual analysis  
- **Clean, structured code** with emphasis on readability and correctness  

---

## Featured Work

⬇️ See my **pinned repositories** below ⬇️  

Each featured project includes:
- Clear problem statement  
- Project structure & design choices  
- How to run the project  
- Sample outputs / visualizations  
- Key learnings and limitations  

I prefer **depth over quantity**.

---

## Current Focus

- Strengthening backend architecture & API design  
- Writing maintainable, production-ready code  
- Improving problem-solving through consistent DSA practice  
- Turning learning projects into polished, explainable work  

---

## Principles I Follow

- Clarity over cleverness  
- One strong project > many weak ones  
- Understanding internals, not just using libraries  
- Consistency beats motivation
