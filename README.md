# Hi, I’m Akshat 👋

🎓 Computer Science undergraduate  
💻 Focused on **Backend Development, Automation, and Applied Machine Learning**

I build **real systems**, not toy demos — projects that involve data, APIs, databases, and clear engineering decisions.

---

## 🔧 What I Build

- **Backend systems** using Node.js, Java, and Python  
- **Automation pipelines** (data collection → processing → output)  
- **Machine Learning projects** with real datasets and proper evaluation  
- Clean, structured code with emphasis on **readability and correctness**

---

## 🚀 Featured Projects
⬇️ See my **pinned repositories** below ⬇️  
Each project includes:
- Clear problem statement  
- How it works  
- How to run it  
- Sample outputs  
- What I learned  

I value **clarity over clutter**.

---

## 🧠 Currently Improving

- Backend architecture & REST API design  
- System design fundamentals  
- Writing production-ready, maintainable code  
- Turning projects into deployable systems

## 📌 Principles I Follow

- Simplicity > unnecessary complexity  
- One strong project > ten weak ones  
- Understanding > memorization  
- Consistency beats motivation
